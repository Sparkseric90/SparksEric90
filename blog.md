<h1>Welcome!</h1>

Welcome to my small corner of the web. I'll be keeping updates here to let everyone know
how it's going with my bootcamp expirence!


<h2>Week 1</h2>
Its been a boots on the ground type of week. Monday we had our orientation to get the layout of how our next few weeks will be.

I started the week like a sponge and tried to soak up as much as I could with the exercises that was provided to us. I've watched many videos, and read a **ton** of articles and tutorials along the way to get a grasp on things. I wasn't nervous starting this journey but knew it would be a tough trying to grasp new things so fast.

Im slowly adapting myself to this. It'll take sometime to be completley comfortable, but i'm making my way down this long road slowly but surely.

I've struggled with learning Git, and all of the terminal commands that go along with it. I'm constantly refering to [Git Cheat Sheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
