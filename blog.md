  <br>
Its been a boots on the ground type of week. Monday we had our orientation to get the layout of how our next few weeks will be.

I started the week like a sponge and tried to soak up as much as I could with the exercises that was provided to us. I've watched many videos, and read a **ton** of articles and tutorials along the way to get a grasp on things. I wasn't nervous starting this journey but knew it would be a tough trying to grasp new things so fast.

Im slowly adapting myself to this. It'll take sometime to be completley comfortable, but i'm making my way down this long road slowly but surely.

I've struggled with learning Git, and all of the terminal commands that go along with it. I'm constantly refering to [Git Cheat Sheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) but i'm getting a grasp on it, the more that I use it.

I'm super excited to further my skills next week. I can see myself getting comfortable doing this the more that I do it. It's been super hard to figure out how to fail, but i'm getting more comfortable with it!

My Goals for the weekend:
* Practice terminal to build muscle memory!
* Use the Dev branch for my projects and get in the norm  of using it!

Wow week 2 has been insane! I personally feel like this week went by super quick! I've wrote simple <strong>HTML</strong> lines in the past, but this week was a real treat! Along with <strong>HTML</strong> I got to look at <strong>CSS</strong> for the first time since the MySpace days! Yeah, its been that long. Who am I kidding though? We all wish that simple social media platform would come back so we could show everyone how great we'll be after bootcamp at writing CSS.

I've learned alot by using pseudocode to help myself to layout my projects and get an idea of how things are going to work! I look forward to using this process more as my journey in bootcamp progress's.

My biggest blockers this week has been the simplest mistakes. Between making grammar errors and using single and double quotes on the same code. I'm finally starting to get the hang of making my code look great!

As i'm coming towards the end of this weeks blog post and I've looked ahead to next week's work. I'm excited to start learning JavaScript. It's been something I've always looked at and wondered to myself "How does that work". Well the beauty is this, i'm finally getting to learn this!

**Html** provides us with the structure we need for our webpages. It helps us layout out exactly what we need to make our websites basic functions work. **CSS** takes that structure a step further and helps us size those sites to fit our phones, laptops, or desktops. It also takes and makes our sites look fancy with all the colors and the ability to apply custom backgrounds. **Java** takes and adds all the fancy features that we all love to our sites. It makes our pages easier to interact with. It also makes our sites able to complete complex functions.

I've re-wrote this section a few times. At first I had a difficult time trying to understand what the question was 
>"What are some objects that your blog incorporates?" 
But after making some changes to pseudo code I realized what it was asking of me. I've used pseudo code to plan out this blog. Wither it be for planning for pictures and how to place them, what quotes to include, or what links to post.

Pseudo code has taught me alot this week. The most important lesson was that not all Pseudo code is the same. Not everyone's will look the same as mine. It's still hard trying to plan something out before I jump into it, but its helping me get a grasp on things as I progress.
